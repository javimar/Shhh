# Shhh!

Welcome to Shhh!


This neat application allows users to pick any place listed in Google Places, and set a Geofence around it so when users enter within a radius of 75 meters, the app will launch silent mode.  When users abandon the area, the app will resume its normal mode.

This is very useful when entering hospitals, religious places, or any place where we don't want to bother others.

App is available in Spanish and English.
